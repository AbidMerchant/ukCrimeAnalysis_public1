Big Data Product: Weapons and Drugs (Individual Work 70%)

These claims were:
    1. Violent Crime is increasing
    2. There are more firearms incidents per head in Birmingham than anywhere else in the UK
    3. Crimes involving firearms are closely associated with drugs offences

Dataset Details:
The Crimes Data:
The data were downloaded from https://data.police.uk/data/. This site offers data by month, and by force. Consequently, 
they have been merged into one file for this assignment. 

You can find out more about the data here (https://data.police.uk/about/#columns). Only ‘street’ files have been included. Outcomes are included.

The header row of the crimes data is:
'Crime ID', 'Month', 'Reported by', 'Falls within', 'Longitude', 'Latitude', 'Location', 
'LSOA code', 'LSOA name', 'Crime type', 'Last outcome category'

Note that Longitude and Latitude are anonymized as described on the police web site here: 
https://data.police.uk/about/#location-anonymisation. Since the police use around 750,000 'anonymous' 
map points it is unlikely that these coincide with the longitudes and latitudes given in the postcode dataset. 
For this reason, it is best to use LSOA (Lower Layer Super Output Area, UK Office for National Statistics) as a region indication. 

The file posttrans.csv will allow the translation of crimes’ longitude and latitude into actual postcodes.
